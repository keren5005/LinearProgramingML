# Linear Programing

## Description
This project uses a custom Logistic Regression class to estimate the probability that an email message is spam. It begins by pre-processing the dataset to make it suitable for analysis. The Logistic Regression model calculates the probability of each email being spam and provides results. Additionally, it displays the weights vector that the model has learned, revealing the significance of different features in identifying spam emails.

Ideal for email security and spam filtering, this project offers a clear view of email probability and enhances spam detection capabilities.
